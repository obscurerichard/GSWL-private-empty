# Alias to access the personal 
# General
#
# In order to have everything from the ecosystem readily available, you'll just
# need to source the alias file. This is done automatically when using
# tmux/tmuxinator. If you don't use tmuxinator *or* when opening a new window
# inside the active tmux session, the following alias comes in handy:
# Ex: alias sl='cd ~/src/GSWL-private && source ~/src/GSWL-ecosystem/alias' # Start ledger

# Tmux / Tmuxinator
#
# Define the alias to start any Ledger interaction. One would usually have a
# decryption and/or mount command before starting the actual session (i.e.
# decrypt /path/to/folder && tmux start).
alias slt='mux start GSWL-private' # Start Ledger Tmux
# Define the alias to stop any Ledger interaction. One would usually have an
# umount and/or an encryption and/or a backup command afterwards (i.e. kill
# tmux kill && encrypt /path/to/folder && backup /path/to/folder)
alias klt='tmux kill-session -t GSWL-private' # Kill Ledger Tmux
